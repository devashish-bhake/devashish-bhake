# Hi There, I'm Devashish Bhake
I'm a recent graduate with a passion for machine learning. I've completed several projects and courses related to machine learning, and I'm excited to continue learning and building my skills in this field.

### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on building my protfolio of machine learning projects/ I'm exploring different topics and techniques, and I'm using Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch and YOLO frameworks to build and deply machine learning models. I also have worked with NLP frameworks like SpaCy and fine-tuned industry leading language models like gpt-2 and T5.

### 🌱 What I'm currently learning
I'm always learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in machine learning. Right now, I'm focused on learning more and more about YOLOv8 which is the newest framework released the YOLOv5's creators Ultralytic, and am excited to see how I can use and apply it on my future projects.

### 💬 Ask me about
If you have any questions about my projects or my experience with machine learning, I'm always happy to chat and share what I've learnt so far.

### 📫 How to reach me

### 🚀 My Gradio Projects
I recently started using Gradio to build interactive demos of my machine learning projects. Here are a few of my recent Gradio projects:
- [Face Mask Detection System](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DevashishBhake/Face_Mask_Detection) 
- [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DevashishBhake/SERModel)

Feel free to check out these projects and let me know what you think! I am always looking for feedback and ways to improve my machine learning projects.
